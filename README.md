# dfplayer
## Overview
This library is for the dfrobot mp3 player

# Use

To use it first declare the dfplayer like this:
```
dfplayer dfp(&Serial3);
```
can also be any other serial

Then set it up in the setup-function like this:
```
dfp.setup();
```
which sets up the Serial port, which was selected in the declaration

After that you can do what you want

# Why is this documentation so shitty

It's as shitty as the library. Ill make it better when I work on the library
